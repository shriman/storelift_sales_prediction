# Storelift sales prediction

## Colab notebooks and preliminary data explorations
The repository contains two colab notebooks, which can be viewed either here in GitHub or in Google Colab (links are in files.)
* [**storelift.ipynb**](https://github.com/shriman/storelift_sales_prediction/blob/main/storelift.ipynb) : 
  * Initial data exploration and data cleaning along with XGBoost model
  * **Data exploration and cleaning and feature engineering**: Read the dataset and generate categorical and numerical features
  * **Data visualization**
  * **Build the train and test set**: Build the cleaned train, test and evaluation data set
  * **Machine learning model**: Test Linear regression and XGBoost models
